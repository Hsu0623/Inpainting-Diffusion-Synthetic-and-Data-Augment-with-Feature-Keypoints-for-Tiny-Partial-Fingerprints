The total released datasets is described:
We have three subdatasets: June, May_01, May_02. In the following link, May_01 is named May_noLabel and May_02 is named May_withLabel.
 
DDIM_fake_matched (which are the synthetic fingerprint from the diffusion sampling with label)：
http://gofile.me/7p5O4/UOPyEKDN9
ddim_unmatched：(which are the synthetic fingerprint from the diffusion sampling without label):
http://gofile.me/7p5O4/1U6KrFaQC
inpaint_with_feature_keypoints (which are synthetic by inpaintin diffusion with feature kepoints, with Label is inpaint_matched_v1, and without Label is virtual_ddim_unmatched.)：
